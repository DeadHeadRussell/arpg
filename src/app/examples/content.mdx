# Conflict of small gods in the Surakhot Market

Meet Kolero.  He's an ancient sorcerer who's found himself in the body of a weak
mortal on a world with customs much different from his own. He also recently
ascended as a minor god of irritation and is trying to find a new body that
suitably represents his power.

Kolero finds himself on the outskirts of Surakhot, a regional capital. However,
upon attempting to enter the city, the guards were paranoid due to recent
unexplained magical events.  This caused Kolero to get irritated and piss off
the guards causing them to try to arrest him.  He was able to escape and flee
to a busy, dusty marketplace.

In an attempt to try and find a new body, Kolero perched himself on a couple of
boxes and watched the market to learn the social dynamics of this culture. The
following tags were bought up:
- **Curiosity 10**: Kolero has a scientific mind and knows how to poke at the right questions
- **Culture -25**: Kolero has a complete lack of cultural knowledge of the world is he on
- **Irascible -20**: Due to his powers of irritation, Kolero gets irascible quickly when he fails at a task

A discussion determined that the **Curiosity** and **Culture** tags would make
this a very hard roll, but the **Irascible** tag would only affect the flavour
of the outcomes if he were to fail the roll.  A roll target of **4** (~4% success)
was set.  The player rolled 3d8-3 and got (6 + 7 + 5 - 3) = **15**.  This
resulted in a **No, and**.

The **No** part of outcome caused Kolero to learn nothing about their culture
and instead become irritated at all of the ways it defied his expectations.  He
started to harass a vendor.  The **and** part of the outcome meant that the
vendor turned out to be a minion of a larger god, Koruteco, who then triggered
a magical explosion and fled, causing guards to descend on their location.

Kolero saw the incoming guards and acted quickly to magically draw upon his
**Irritation Magic** powers and stir the dusty irritants all around into a wall
of dust directing the guards attention towards the fleeing Koruteco minion and
away from himself.  The following tags were discussed:
- **Irritation Magic 41**: Kolero is a minor god of irritation
- **Physics 15**: Kolero is generally learned about the natural laws that govern this universe
- **Dusty**: The scene was described as being a dusty marketplace

Creating a wall of dust from nothing would be an extremely hard task, even for a
minor god, however, since the marketplace was described as having dust swirling
all about and since Kolero has learned knowledge of physics, they decided that
he would be able to easily take advantage of the dust make the roll moderately
easy with a target of **12**.  The player rolled  (3 + 4 + 2 - 3) = **6**.  This
resulted in a **Yes**.

The outcome was that Kolero was successfully able to raise the wall of dust and
direct all of the guards towards the Koruteco minion.  However, he was unable to
turn to push this into a further advantage and left the scene without further
incident.
