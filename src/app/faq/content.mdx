# Downtime / rests?

Just another scene with actions that take time.

How long does it actually take to recover from that bleeding?  Does it
scab over on its own or is it deep enough that it needs to be treated?

How do you de-stress after a close call during a battle?


# Where to Start?

- Have everyone work together to what character goals they want
- Build a setting to best fit these character motivations
- Build characters to have interesting strengths and weaknesses in this setting


# Balance

Stats are based loosely around chess elo.  Each 5 points is 400 elo, meaning
rolling at your level is a 50/50 chance, and one level below is a 90/10 chance,
and vice versa for above.
