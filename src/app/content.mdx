# What is ARPG

ARPG is a generic role playing game that focuses on characters, their unique
traits and desired story arcs.  It is meant to be a collaborative (to a fault)
story telling system first, but provides room for some tactical and strategic
play as well.  The rules are also very easy to modify and adapt as you and your
settings require.

## Why a new system

I could not find an existing system that combined building PCs with a background
/ character first focus with good rewards for a diverse set of players.
