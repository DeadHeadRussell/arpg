# Overview
A scene describes a situation.  Who is involved, what are the stakes, and how
can the characters influence events to wind up in their favour.

# Creating a scene
- A good scene describes a situation.  Who is involved, and what are the stakes for each member.  How can the characters influence the stakes to end up in their favour?
- Tags should be based on the above.  You do not have to describe every single characteristic of the scene up front, but at least the ones that provide interest
- Consider some Broad tags to cover larger groups of characteristics in a scene.  Eg, “+5 to all rolls to find small items”
- Tags can also apply to just portions of a scene as well.  Eg, “This area has +5 to finding trinkets and this other area has -10 to all ground movement”
- What timescale do actions take in a scene?  Are we talking seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, etc, etc?

# Dynamic scenes
- Be ready to define tags on the fly throughout the scene.  React to player input and let everyone have a say on what should exist.
- Think more about the desired difficulty than about if “something exists”.  Eg, “you might be able to find barrels to hide in, but it would be at a -30 roll”.
- Players should be encouraged to be creative with the environment and have fun

# Scene actions
- Does the scene change on its own?  Eg, a volcano is erupting
- Want to model many background characters as part of the scene? Eg, a crowded market ebbs and flows throughout the morning.
- Think about what actions the scene itself can take, how often it takes them, and how difficult those actions are (eg, does the scene roll based on its tags, or do they just happen?)

# Character preparation
- What preparation have the characters made coming into the scene?  Turn that preparation into tags!  This can be in the form of intel making their moves easier, or maybe in the form of planted resources that help them out.
