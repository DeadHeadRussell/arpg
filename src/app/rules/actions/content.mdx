    # Overview

    Actions are used when a character wants to do something in a scene and the
    players are unsure of what the result will be. To preform an action, the player
    states what their character is trying to accomplish and how their character is
    going about it.  The group then discusses which tags are relevant and determines
    a difficulty for the action.  The player then rolls against that difficulty.


    ## Relevant tags

    Relevant tags can come from anywhere. The character performing the action, other
    characters involved in the scene either for or against the action, scene tags,
    modifiers from previous actions, expected difficulty of the action, etc. All players
    should bring up any tags that they feel apply to the action at hand.

    However, it is often too overwhelming to list a tag for every single aspect of a
    scene.  Keep the tags to just the characteristics that stand out and create a
    single "Difficulty" tag that represents everything else.  The "Difficulty" tag
    could represent anything from environment factors, cultural expectations,
    emotional state of the character or even just the gut feeling of the players.
    If you are uncertain, just say something that feels right as a starting point
    and adapt as you learn from there.


    ## Partial application

    Some tags don't cleanly apply to the action at hand. When that happens, consider
    how the tag is related to the action with the [tag hierarchy](/rules/tags#hierarchy)
    or just a general feeling.  

    If you can justify a wider application of the tag, divide the tag value by the
    hierarchy ratio and add that value instead.


    ## Using relationships

    When two or more characters work together, they can combine their tags to have a
    chance at a better outcome. The higher their relationship tag value the better
    they are able to work together.  Decide on which character will make the main roll.
    Then have each other character roll to determine how well their help actually is.
    Then modify the roll target of the main roll based on the previous rolls and
    make the main roll.

    
    ## Difficulty

    Once all tags are determined, combine them into a single difficulty that the player
    will roll against.  This difficulty is a number from 0 to 21 where lower is harder.
    A few good baselines are:
    - -1: 1 in a million (ok, its actually just 1 in 500, but it sure feels like 1 in a million to the players when it lands)
    - 4: very hard (4% success)
    - 8: hard (25% success)
    - 10: medium (40% success)
    - 11: average (50% success)
    - 14: easy (75% success)
    - 17: very easy (90% success)
    - 20: can't fail (99% success)


    # Timing

    How long actions should take usually depends on how tense a scene is. When the
    outcome of the scene really matters, consider fine grain actions to help add
    tension to the outcomes. However, when it the outcomes aren't as stressful it
    is usually time to zoom out and have actions that result in more at a time.

    Time is handled loosely. In the scene, all characters are acting simultaneously,
    however, that is difficult to act out without slowing the game down. Instead,
    encourage your players to work together to come up with creative solutions. If
    timing of actions is becoming an issue, consider applying one of the optional
    rules around [time contention](/rules/optional-rules#time-contention).


    # Outcomes

    To resolve an action, roll 3d8-3 and compare the result to the target value.
    How close or far the roll is from the target determines the level of success.
    The levels of success are:
    - Yes, and
    - Yes
    - Yes, but
    - Something interesting happens
    - No, but
    - No
    - No, and

    See the graph on this page for more details around the levels of success and
    expected values based on different targets.
