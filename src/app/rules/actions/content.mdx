    # Overview

    Actions are used when a character wants to do something in a scene and the
    players are unsure of what the result will be. To preform an action, the player
    states what their character is trying to accomplish. Then, all relevant tags are
    added or subtracted which represents the target value.

    Relevant tags can come from anywhere. The character performing the action, other
    characters involved in the scene either for or against the action, scene tags,
    or expected difficulty of the action. Work with the players on each action to
    best understand which tags are applicable.


    ## Cultural average

    When a character rolls with a +0 target, that means they are average at their
    action compared to the cultural expectations. To represent this cultural average
    all rolls get a +10. If there situations where this cultural norm should not
    fully apply consider modifying this value.


    ## Timing

    How long actions should take usually depends on how tense a scene is. When the
    outcome of the scene really matters, consider fine grain actions to help add
    tension to the outcomes. However, when it the outcomes aren't too important it
    is usually time to zoom out and have actions that result in more at a time.

    Time is handled loosely. In the scene, all characters are acting simultaneously,
    however, that is difficult to act out without slowing the game down. Instead,
    encourage your players to work together to come up with creative solutions. If
    timing of actions is becoming an issue, consider applying one of the optional
    rules around [time contention](/rules/optional-rules#time-contention).


    ## Partial application

    Some tags don't cleanly apply to the action at hand. When that happens, consider
    how the tag is related to the action with the [tag hierarchy](/rules/tags#hierarchy).
    If you can justify a wider application of the tag, divide the tag value by the
    hierarchy ratio and add that value instead.


    ## Using relationships

    When two or more characters work together, they can combine their tags to have a
    chance at a better outcome. The higher their relationship tag value the better
    they are able to work together. How this works? I dunno, haven't fully worked
    through the math yet, but consider;
    - All parties roll or one rolls. Take best outcome?
    - Only weaker side rolls and adds relationship bonus?
    - Add a bonus that scales based on value of relationship?  Eg, pros add full value from each, beginners only add a bit, gods add double?
    - Relationships can also be used against other characters, how does that work?


    # Outcomes

    To resolve an action, roll 3d8-3 and compare the result to the target value.
    How close or far the roll is from the target determines the level of success.
    The levels of success are:
    - Yes, and
    - Yes
    - Yes, but
    - Something interesting happens
    - No, but
    - No
    - No, and

    See the graph on this page for more details around the levels of success and
    expected values based on different targets.


    # Common questions/actions

    - discover tags (eg, insight into a character, investigating a scene)
    - modify tags
      - give yourself / ally better tags (heal, invigorate, don armour, grow a bond)
      - give your opponent worse tags (attack, intimidate, steal money from, sow discontent)
      - modify environment tags (cause a rock slide, burn a building, clean up a river, poison food)
