    # Overview

    Tags are used to describe the important characteristics of the characters,
    scenes, objects, or anything else that players might interact with during a
    game.  These can be physical attributes, conditions, resources or clocks.  The
    examples section has a collection of tags to help get the creative juices
    flowing.  However, tags can represent anything; be creative and be dynamic!

    Each tag has a name, a level, and a short description.  The level is a positive
    integer that describes how much or severe a tag is.  The description should let
    the players know what the tag is and how it will interact with the other
    elements of the game.  An example of this might be the tag “Mountainous 10: The
    terrain in this region is full of mountains, valleys, rivers and steep cliffs.
    Travelling through this region is difficult.”

    A good way to represent tags is through cards.  Name and level up top, description below.


    # Levels

    Each tag has a level that measures how strong the tag is.  This level is used
    whenever you need to compare tags to each other, or to some expected state, for
    example, when resolving actions or determining the effects of a condition.  This
    level ranges from 0-50, however, depending on how it is interacted with, it
    might be a positive or a negative value.

    At level 50 or above, the tag’s value is beyond our ability to comprehend.
    While there is nothing stopping you from using higher numbers, feeling the need
    to is probably a sign that something else is astray.  Consider setting up
    challenges for players that use different types of tags or retiring characters
    when there is no challenge left for them.

    The table below shows categories for each 5 levels.  These names are here to
    help think about how impactful a level is and have no bearing on any gameplay.
    These categories can be replaced with your own vernacular, or completely ignored
    if you prefer just using the numbers.


    # Hierarchy

    Because of how open tags are to interpretation some might be used more often
    than others.  Some also might be similar or related to other tags.  The tag
    hierarchy helps structure tags to give some guidelines when creating tags and
    resolving actions with tags that partially apply.

    The ratio for a tier can be used to convert between related tags.  Eg, “Short
    swords 5”, a normal skill, would convert to “Blades 1”, allowing a character to
    use a different bladed weapon with a level 1 tag.  In most cases this only
    allows you to convert to higher hierarchy tiers.

    Tags that have a broader hierarchy should be harder to modify.
    If attributes are used too often or not often enough, work with the other
    players to modify them to better suit the intent
