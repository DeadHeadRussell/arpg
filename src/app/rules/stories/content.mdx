Want your game to have a storytelling aspect to it?  Here are some guidelines on how to do it collaboratively
- make it known up front what parts of the story each person will be responsible for
  - eg, are you splitting it up by time in the story (intro vs twist, or each player gets a scene in each section)
  - or are you splitting it up by zoom (overarching plot vs actions taken to advance the plot)
  - or is it just rotating each scene letting the plot advance naturally?
- consider using a plot guide, such as kishotenketsu, etc
- or maybe just a single story master is right for you
