# Core of the game

Getting started is simple! All you need to play is:
- 1 or more players to control characters, scenes and stories
- A way to track the world and its characters.  This could be pen and paper, your memory, tokens and maps, or whatever you prefer to use.
- 3d8 dice, or 1 d8 die that you roll a lot, or a computer to roll dice for you.
- Everyone's imagination! This is your time to have fun with the people around you. Enjoy it.

Once you have everything above, the core game play goes as follows:
- Run a session 0
- Create characters
- Put your characters into scenes that help them accomplish their drive
- Repeat until the characters have accomplished their drive!


# Session 0

Aka, why is there no GM in this game?? ARPG doesn't require a separation between
a single GM and PCs.  However, based ont he game you want to play you might want
one.  Ask everyone at the table what interests them about TTRPGs.  Determine who
is responsible for what parts of the game or choose a method that will be used
throughout.  Regardless of what is chosen everyone should be clear for what they
are responsible for before you start, but don't be afraid to iterate mid-game.

Here are some game elements that players will need to be in charge of:
- Each character
- Each faction
- Each scene
- The story

Here are some ways to assign responsibility:
- Normal, eg, 1 GM and 1 character per player
- Rotating, eg, control changes after some set time, eg, each scene
- Collaborative, eg, anyone can suggest anything at any time. I hope you have solid friendships

Here are some example setups:
- Do you like to solve puzzles or tactical battles? Consider a puzzle master that controls scenes, NPCs and factions key to the puzzles.
- Do you like to tell a story with plot twists? Consider a single story master
- Do you like to drive character development through interesting situations? Consider a single player per key character and a rotating scene master.
- Are you here to flex your role playing prowess? Consider rotating control of characters with each scene change.
- Do you want a fun 2 player dynamic? Consider a problem "creator" and "solver" split that rotates after each challenge is overcome.
- Do you want to have fun world building? Consider a large time scale where you swap roles with each era.
