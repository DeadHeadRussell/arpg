# Overview

A character is made up of their drive, a series of tags representing what is
unique about this character and how their destiny has help up throughout their
story. The tags are broken down into multiple categories based on expectations
on how they can be used and modified in the future.

The full breakdown of a character is:
- **Description**: what is apparent when interacting with this character
- **Drive**: the motivation for the character
- **Relationships**: the strength of a bond with other characters
- **Attributes**: The skills, abilities and other personal facets that make up the character
- **Resources**: What items, knowledge or other resources a character has access to
- **Conditions**: Temporary changes to a character that impact their ability
- **Destiny**: One time use improvements to help players control their characters story

All characters are controlled by someone but need not be restricted to a single
person. How important characters are to the story should determine how deeply
defined they are. These is no need to spend a lot of time defining a character
up front when they will appear for just a single scene.  Additionally,
characters can be further defined if they happen to show up again.


## Description

The character's description is there to help the players picture the character
in their head and immerse themselves when interacting with that character. To
help build a description, think about what would other beings remember about
them after an interaction.

## Drive

A character's drive is their purpose in life. It is used to help guide the
characters through the story and their actions should be heavily influenced by
their drive. If a player is ever in doubt with what a character would do, think
about what would help them move towards their drive.

When a character achieves significant progress towards their drive they gain a
positive destiny. When they accomplish their entire drive or is no longer able
to accomplish it, how do they feel? Are they done adventuring and settle down?
Do they have a new goal in life they are trying to achieve? Think about what
makes sense for them based on their previous drive and their general attitude.

It can help to think about the drive by breaking it down into the following
questions:
- What is your current situation?
- What are you trying to accomplish?
- What stands in your way?

Some simple examples of drive:
- My family was murdered by a foul beast. I want revenge. I am not able to track the beast myself.
- I was shipwrecked and thrown way off course by a terrible storm. I want to find my way home. I do not know where I am.
- I was raised in a society with high expectations of true love. I want to find true love. I do not know what true love really is.


## Relationships

A character's relationships represents the special people or factions they have
either formed strong bonds with or know really well.  The higher the value of
the relationship tag the better the two sides can work together, or mess each
other up. Relationships can be asymmetrical if one side has put in extra effort
to learn about the other.

A relationship can be thought of with the following the parts:
- Who is it with?
- The value of the tag
- How did the relationship form?
- What open questions are there?

When a character answers open questions about their relationship, they increase
the relationship's value and update how the relationship formed and what open
questions there are. See character improvement below for more details.

Keep in mind that relationships are not always positive. Think of a relationship
with a rival or nemesis. Or maybe you have been fed false information and you
no longer know what is truth or fiction for another character.


## Attributes

The attributes represent what skills, traits, characteristics, etc make this
character unique. These attributes are more permanent than the other character
tags and require dedication throughout the story to improve. They can also be
negative, representing what your character is uniquely bad at.

Attributes are best thought about as how they were formed as opposed to what
they do. This helps make sure everyone knows how it can be used and is a great
way to add more flavour to a character.

An attribute can be thought of with the following parts:
- A name to reference it
- The value of the tag
- The tag hierarchy it falls under
- How was it formed?

A few examples of where attributes can come from?
- What schooling or training have the character had?
- What hobbies do they have?
- What are they good / bad at?


## Resources

Resources are tags that easy to gain or lose. This is anything from gear to
consumables, money or intel. Some gear don't have a special value but the
character must have to enable specific actions. Eg, you cannot swing a sword if
you don't have one!


## Conditions

Conditions are positive or negative tags that have applied to the character
externally and can be removed either given time or specific actions.

Negative conditions are a common way to apply "bad things" when actions go
wrong. They are used instead of HP of any kind. Negative conditions should be
narrow to avoid a death spiral of negative effects, eg, a broken leg should
make movement harder, but should not impact other abilities.

A condition can be thought of with the following parts:
- A name to reference it
- The vaule of the tag
- When, where and who it came from
- What effects it causes
- How it will improve

A few examples of conditions are:
- Stress from bullying by Billy at school. Makes thinking about school very emotional.
- Sprained ankle from the sword duel. Side to side movement is painful.
- Bad mood from sleeping through the alarm. Makes interactions with other people very irritable.
- In the zone solving a complicated problem. Everything just clicks into place.
- Increased arm muscles from drinking a potion of strength. Arms are strong now.


## Destiny

Destiny is a way to allow players to better control the story arc of their
characters. It should be used as a carrot for good play and a stick for unfun
play. Positive destiny is used to improve a character's chances in a key moment
while negative destiny is used by other players to hurt a character's chances.

Positive destiny can be gained by:
- Using negative attributes
- Progressing your story
- Progressing your character
- Rule of cool
- Use them when you want a benefit!

Negative destiny can be gained by:
- Abusing positive attributes
- Ignoring your characters drive
- Rule of cool
- Other players used against you when someone else wants a benefit

Uses of destiny includes:
- Increase your roll chances by +5
- Reroll an action roll
- Modify tags temporarily
- Trigger a flashback
- Modify the rules of the game in some creative way


# Character Lifecycle

## Creation
Variable stats based on style of campaign
Characters could start with...
- 125+ and 50- for a fates pyramid style / action hero
- 200+ and 10- for special people??


## Improvement
- Characters improve based on their own actions
- Consider both what has gotten better and what has gotten worse during character improvement
- There is no single way to know when a character should improve, but here are some guidelines.
  - Repetition and retrospection.  Characters improve when they spend a lot of time repeating the same successful motion, and being retrospective on when things don’t go well.  However, repeating unsuccessful actions can create bad habits that make future progress hard.
  - Mentorship.  Having someone that has appropriate knowledge can guide your character through improving can greatly improve their progress.  This can be a good way to have characters help bring each other up to their level and keep the party balanced.  The higher relationship two characters have, the easier this is.
  - Learning a skill that is similar to one you already have helps you learn it faster.
  - Atrophy.  Attributes can get worse over time if not used.
  - Too much stress, can permanently affect the character’s abilities
- Improvements can happen at different times:
  - During RP
  - As dedicated actions
  - From normal actions throughout the story
  - At the end of sessions
- Broad tags should be much harder to improve than specific tags
  - If characters get “generic” points to add to their tags, consider a 3:1 conversion ratio
- Characters do not have to improve at the same time, however, having disparate skill levels is an easy way to make the story unfun for players.  Make sure everyone is happy with how the improvements are happening!

## Ending
- Not all characters have to last the entire story
- Some might decide their time is done, either due to physical/mental stress, completing their arc, or the story simply diverging from what they are trying to accomplish
- Retirement / proteges?
