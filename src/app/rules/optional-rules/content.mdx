# Hidden Info
Sometimes it can be interesting for players to not have all information to help them better act as their character.  However, it can also be difficult to figure this all out up front.  Here are some ideas if you like the idea of hidden info.
- Require the players to investigate a scene or character to determine some or all of their tags.
- Reveal tags as the scene or characters use their tags
- Update the tags based on failed rolls to better describe why an action was hard


# Time Contention
Too complex, re-evaluate.  Maybe just make a contested roll? Or just whoever rolled better on the action?

- If time is a limited resource, use time tokens.
- All players have a set of "time" tokens
- DM and player(s) negotiate how many time tokens a question takes
- When all players have run out of time tokens, an environment round happens, then they are all returned
- DMs can use actions normally during the environment round
- DMs or players can intervene at any point by using 1 (more?) extra action
